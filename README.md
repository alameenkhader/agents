# AI Agents Lab

A collection of AI agents in development. Each agent resides in its own directory with dedicated documentation and implementation.

## Available Agents

- **Commit Message Generator** (`/commit_message/`) - AI-powered git commit message generator
- **Multi-Tool Agent** (`/multi_tool_agent/`) - Programming assistant with shell capabilities
- **Weather Agent** (`agent.py`) - Simple weather information assistant

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.12 and Ollama
2. Check each agent's directory for specific setup and usage instructions

Note: These agents are in development. Once mature, they will be moved to dedicated repositories.
